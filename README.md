# Build My First App

This is my first app built using Expo, featuring two main functionalities:

- **Wallpaper Fetching:**  
  Fetch high-quality wallpapers from a reliable API.

- **AI Generated Wallpapers:**  
  Generate unique wallpapers using an AI model based on user inputs.

The app also allows users to save wallpapers directly to their device gallery for easy access later.
